### Data Story:  ABC Company Employee Dataset

The analysis of ABC Company’s employee data reveals several interesting trends. First, when looking at the distribution of employees across teams, it’s clear that most employees work in Team A and Team B, which together make up around 60% of the entire workforce. This suggests that these two teams are central to the company’s work. On the other hand, smaller teams like Team C and Team D have fewer employees, which likely means these teams focus on more specialized tasks. The large difference in team sizes hints that the company might focus more on certain areas, with room to expand in others.

When we look at job roles within the company, most employees hold mid-level positions such as "Analyst" and "Associate." There are fewer people in higher roles like "Manager" or "Director." This structure is typical in most companies, where the majority of staff work in operational roles, and only a few are in leadership. This could also mean there’s potential for employees to grow and move into more senior positions over time.

In terms of employee age, the majority fall within the 26-35 age group, which makes up nearly half of the workforce. This suggests that the company has a relatively young team, likely in the midst of building their careers. The second-largest age group is 36-45, showing that there is also a good mix of more experienced professionals. This combination of youth and experience could be beneficial for the company, bringing both fresh ideas and seasoned expertise.

Looking at salary spending, it’s clear that Team A and Team C have the highest salary costs. This could mean that these teams include more senior or specialized employees, who are paid higher salaries. Similarly, the higher-ranking positions like "Senior Manager" and "Director" have the biggest share of the salary budget, which makes sense since leadership roles typically come with higher pay. These findings highlight where the company’s salary resources are being spent the most.

Lastly, we found a positive relationship between age and salary, meaning that as employees get older, their salaries tend to increase. This is expected since more experienced employees generally earn more as they progress in their careers. The data shows that this trend is consistent across the company, with older employees typically earning higher salaries than younger ones.

In summary, the analysis of ABC Company’s employee data provides a clear picture of the workforce. The company has a young, growing team, mostly concentrated in key areas, with salary spending focused on senior roles. These insights can help the company in planning for future growth, team development, and salary management.
